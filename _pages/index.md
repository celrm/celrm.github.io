I am a PhD candidate at the [Relational ML Lab](https://relationalml.github.io), supervised by [Dr. Rebekka Burkholz](https://sites.google.com/view/rebekkaburkholz/), at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Saarbrücken, Germany.

I am interested in the theory of machine learning, with a recent focus on addressing the challenges of generalization in graph learning.
